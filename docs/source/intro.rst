Introduction
============

``dbSketcher`` is a simple program to sketch a dB out from a CSV file with minimal code

Motivation
**********

During the development of another program, I needed a tool to help me design a database, so ``dbSketcher`` was born.

Limitations
***********

- The code was developed just as an aid tool. No unit tests were done, and several errors can arise without explanation if the initial syntax of the CSV file is not properly done.
